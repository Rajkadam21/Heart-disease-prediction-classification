# HeartGuardian: Predicting Cardiac Wellness
## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. It utilizes machine learning classification techniques to analyze a dataset containing a combination of demographic information, lifestyle factors, and medical test results. The predictive model helps identify individuals at risk of heart disease, enabling early intervention and personalized healthcare.

## Key Features

- Data Exploration: Comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand patterns, correlations, and potential factors influencing heart disease.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- Feature Selection: Identification and selection of relevant features that contribute significantly to the predictive model.

- Model Selection: Implementation of multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Comparison of their performances to choose the most suitable model.

- Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of the chosen model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilization of cross-validation to ensure robustness.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning of model parameters to optimize performance and generalization.

- Visualization: Clear and informative visualizations of key insights, model performance, and feature importance.

- Deployment: Optionally, a simple deployment script or API for making predictions based on the trained model.
